# Varo to Monarch

Convert Varo Bank PDF statements to Monarch Money CSV format. No more manual
data entry — point the tool at your Varo statements and get a Monarch-ready CSV
in seconds.

## Features

- 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI**: Graphical interface for non-technical users (also
  available as standalone executables)
- 📄 **Hybrid PDF Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for table-based extraction and
  pdfplumber for text-based parsing to capture all transactions, including
  multi-line descriptions that span page boundaries
- 🔄 **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple PDFs concurrently with
  configurable worker count
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Rich progress bars with per-file status
- 💰 **Smart Amount Handling**: Automatically applies correct sign per section
  (purchases negative, payments positive, etc.)
- 🎯 **Intelligent Section Detection**: Identifies and categorises Purchases,
  Payments/Credits, Fees, and Secured Account transactions
- 🏦 **Account Mapping**: Maps transactions to the correct account (Varo Believe
  Card vs Varo Secured Account)
- 📝 **Monarch-Ready Output**: CSV with the exact columns Monarch Money expects

## Installation

### Option 1: Standalone Executable (Recommended for Non-Technical Users)

Download the pre-built executable for your OS from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/blacksuan19/varo-to-monarch/releases):

- **Windows**: `varo-to-monarch-windows.exe`
- **macOS**: `varo-to-monarch-macos.app.zip` (extract and run)
- **Linux**: `varo-to-monarch-linux`

No installation required — just download and run.

### Option 2: Install via pip

```bash
pip install varo-to-monarch
```

### Option 3: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blacksuan19/varo-to-monarch.git
cd varo-to-monarch
pip install .
```

## Usage

### GUI

**Standalone executable:** double-click the downloaded file.

**Installed package:**

```bash
vtm-gui
```

The GUI lets you:

1. Select the folder containing your Varo PDF statements
2. Choose the output CSV path (defaults to `varo_monarch_combined.csv` in the
   input folder)
3. Optionally set a filename pattern, worker count, and whether to include the
   source filename column

Click **Convert to Monarch CSV** and watch the progress bar.

### CLI

**Basic usage** — convert all PDFs in a folder:

```bash
vtm path/to/statements
```

Output is written to `path/to/statements/varo_monarch_combined.csv` by default.

**All options:**

```
vtm [OPTIONS] [FOLDER]

Arguments:
  FOLDER  Directory containing Varo PDF statements

Options:
  -o, --output PATH               Output CSV file path
  -p, --pattern TEXT              Glob pattern for PDFs (default: *.pdf)
  -w, --workers INT               Parallel workers (default: auto)
      --include-file-names /
      --no-include-file-names     Include/exclude SourceFile column (default: include)
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Custom output path
vtm ./statements --output ~/monarch_import.csv

# Process only a specific statement
vtm ./statements --pattern "2025-12.pdf"

# Use 4 parallel workers
vtm ./statements --workers 4

# Omit the source filename column from output
vtm ./statements --no-include-file-names
```

## Output Format

| Column          | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Date`          | Transaction date (`MM/DD/YYYY`)                              |
| `Merchant Name` | Full transaction description                                 |
| `Account`       | `Varo Believe Card` or `Varo Secured Account`                |
| `Amount`        | Signed amount (negative = debit, positive = credit)          |
| `SourceFile`    | Source PDF filename (omitted with `--no-include-file-names`) |

## How It Works

The tool uses a two-pass hybrid extraction strategy:

1. **Table extraction (PyMuPDF)** — detects and extracts transaction tables
   directly from the PDF structure. Handles Purchases, Fees, Payments and
   Credits, and Secured Account Transactions sections.

2. **Text parsing (pdfplumber)** — line-by-line fallback for transactions that
   table detection misses. All pages are flattened into a single line list
   before parsing so that multi-line descriptions split across page boundaries
   are correctly merged.

3. **Deduplication** — results from both passes are merged; rows already
   captured by table extraction are not duplicated from the text pass.

4. **Section-based classification** — each transaction is assigned the correct
   account and amount sign based on which section it appears in:

   | Section                      | Sign     | Account              |
   | ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
   | Purchases                    | negative | Varo Believe Card    |
   | Fees                         | negative | Varo Believe Card    |
   | Payments and Credits         | positive | Varo Believe Card    |
   | Secured Account Transactions | from PDF | Varo Secured Account |

5. **Post-processing** — description-based rules override section assignments
   where needed (e.g. transfer descriptions always go to Varo Secured Account
   regardless of which table they appear in).

## Supported Transaction Types

### Varo Believe Card

- Credit card purchases
- Fees and charges
- Payments and credits

### Varo Secured Account

- Transfers from Secured Account to Believe Card
  (`Trf from Vault to Charge C Bal`)
- Transfers from Secured Account to Checking (`Transfer from Vault to DDA`)
- Deposits into Secured Account (`Move Your Pay - Chk to Believe`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

## Troubleshooting

**No transactions extracted:**

- Make sure the PDFs are genuine Varo Bank statements
- Check that the files are not password-protected or corrupted

**Missing transactions:**

- The tool handles multi-page statements automatically
- Try `--workers 1` to rule out any concurrency issues

**Wrong amounts or accounts:**

- Open an issue on GitHub with a redacted sample statement
